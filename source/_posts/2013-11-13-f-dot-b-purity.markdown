Some of my Facebook friends have enough free time to tepost stupid Facebook page images, Tumblr gifs and other crap. Others are just not clever enough. The worst is when there's a new reality show on the TV, a new internet meme or "just-share-crap" trend. I don't wanna be part of that. **[F.B. Purity](http://www.fbpurity.com/)** helps me to filter the Facebook wall with more advanced tools than the standart FB options. It supports custom words blacklist. Mine is shared on **[GitHub](https://github.com/eniac111/F.B.-PurityBlacklist)**. :)
