It's been a while since my last post. The last scandals around Facebook about the data abuse forced me to write some blog posts about the *Indie Web* principles.

You know that you can send emails between accounts in Gmail, Yahoo or Microsoft. Also, you can have company mail or a personal one on your own domain. The email server can be hosted in a hosting company or in your basement and so.. That's because the email protocols are standard and open, just like *HTTP*, the protocol that is running the web. We have different web servers and web browsers and they communicate the same way with HTTP. If it was a closed protocol, we would have been forced to use different applications to open given web sites.
On the other side, for example, Skype is proprietary application and it's protocol of communication is closed. The Skype servers are on the Microsoft's infrastructure and you can't install your own instance. Also, you can not communicate between Skype and Facebok Messenger or Google Hangouts. Do you remember how many times this company was sold? It was sold together with your data. Your chat history, friends list and your login location logs. 

Remember that Facebook is not the only evil in the picture. Do you know where is your data?
The idea of Internet is to be a global network of computers with different levels of access between them. In the last years, the tendentions are that the services are being centralized   



1. Safest locations to host your data
2. Domains
3. Emails, Calendars, Conctacts
3. Web chat, instant messaging and Video/Audio calls
4. Social networks
5. Cloud file storage services
6. Backup
7. Web site and publishing platforms
8. Operating systems
