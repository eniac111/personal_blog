It's been a long time since my last post here. There are several reasons for this but the main one is laziness. Although, system administrators should be lazy.

Another reason was the blog platform ( [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) ). Last week I worked for about two evenings to migrate the website to a new platform.

As well as he last one, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) Hexo, became difficult to maintain. Most of the community support of Hexo comes from China and the documentation is in Chinese. It was also slow and the `node_modules` was huge for a content generator.

The new platform of my choice was [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Before it I gave a try to Wordpress but the poor WYSIWYG editor and the complexity made me give up quickly.

### Hugo 
is really simple and fast. Because it's writen in Golang, it's distributed in a single binary. The community is active and it supports different options for deployment and a lot of plugins. The maintenance of the project is easier because it doesn't require many dependencies like the other content generators. 

There was some debt with the old syntax of the posts that were generated by the old platforms. The main problem was the syntax of the code snippets from Hexo which was not standard. Also the picture links is different and the directory structure. Automatic content converter would be a good weekend project.

### Comments

Currently, the Disqus comments are not imported. It's an easy to use free platform but I have some concerns about the privacy and security. The company was sold to a BigData corporation in 2017 and they use the data to track the user activity.
Comments aren't so important but I'm still considering several self-hosted Open Source alternatives. Isso or Talkyard might be the options. There is a [page about different comment services](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/) in the Hugo's documentation.

### Design

Thanks to [JM Fergeau](https://jmf-portfolio.netlify.app/) for the great terminal theme! :) 

It's based on the  [Bootstrap 386](https://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/) template.
