Some of my Facebook friends have enough free time to repost stupid Facebook page images, Tumblr gifs and other crap. Others are just not clever enough. The worst is when there's a new reality show on the TV, a new internet meme or "just-share-crap" trend. I don't want to be a part of that. **[F.B. Purity](http://www.fbpurity.com/)** helps me to filter the Facebook wall with more advanced tools than the standartd FB options. It supports custom words blacklists. Mine is shared on **[GitHub](https://github.com/eniac111/F.B.-PurityBlacklist)**. :)
