In the age of information overload, it's crucial to find the right tool that streamlines our online reading experience. While there are numerous feed aggregators in the market, [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) has emerged as my aggregator of choice. Here’s why:

## 1. A Minimalistic User Interface for a Distraction-Free Experience

First and foremost, what captured my attention about Miniflux is its blazing fast and minimalistic user interface. No flashy banners, unnecessary widgets, or pop-ups. It's just you and the content. This clean UI ensures that readers like me can focus solely on what we came for: the content.

## 2. Seamless Integration of the "Download" Feature

Often, many articles on feeds offer only a snippet, compelling us to visit the original website filled with ads and cookie prompts. Miniflux elegantly circumvents this issue with its "Download" button. Much like the Firefox reader mode, it attempts to fetch the entire article content, providing a clutter-free reading experience.

## 3. Navigate with Ease with Keyboard Shortcuts

Miniflux has built-in keyboard shortcuts that make moving around the app really easy. Instead of always using the mouse or touch controls, you can use keys to quickly jump between articles or different sections. It's a handy feature that saves time and makes reading more smooth.

## 4. Compatibility Across Devices and Platforms

I'm someone who hops between devices often, and Miniflux's synchronization between web and mobile clients is invaluable. I use [Miniflutt](https://github.com/DocMarty84/miniflutt) on Android and [NewsFlash](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk) on my Plasma Desktop. It's worth noting that Miniflutt, being a versatile client, supports APIs from various feed aggregators, making it a universal choice for many.

## 5. A Unified Hub for Organized Information

The sheer volume of information online can be overwhelming. Miniflux's categorization feature allows me to sort and curate my feeds, ensuring I see what I want and can effortlessly skip unwanted content.
Speaking of a daily unwanted content, I would like to recommend a book on this topic: ["The Information Diet"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-information-diet/9781449321536/) by `Clay Johnson`. 

## 6. An Open Call for Collaborators

In the past, I’ve dedicated time to scripts that generated Atom feeds from platforms like Facebook and Instagram. However, maintenance became a herculean task. While I'm open to supporting new projects in this vein, it requires collaborative effort. So, if you're someone keen on innovating in this space, let's chat!

## 7. A Better Alternative for Our Elders

The older generation, unfortunately, often becomes a target for misleading news and propaganda, especially from platforms like Google News (The top news sites targetted in Bulgaria are fake news! ) and the social media. With Miniflux, we have the potential to curate better, verified, and credible content for them, fostering a safer online environment. This is part of my wider plan for an unified Android image for the family.

## NextCloud News

Before settling on Miniflux, I extensively used the NextCloud News application. It's a commendable application, offering many functionalities similar to Miniflux and integrating well into the NextCloud ecosystem. However, several factors led me to prefer Miniflux. It operates with unmatched speed, and its minimalistic design keeps the focus squarely on content. Additionally, Miniflux's independence from platforms like NextCloud offers flexibility, especially as I'm considering a transition to OwnCloud Infinite Scale in the future. While Miniflux is my preferred choice, NextCloud News undeniably deserves recognition in the feed aggregator space.
