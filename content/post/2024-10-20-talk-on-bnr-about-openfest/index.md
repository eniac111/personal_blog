On October 10th, I had the pleasure of joining [Bogomil (Bogo) Shopov](https://bogomil.info/) on the Bulgarian national radio program "[Horizont](https://bnr.bg/horizont)" in their show "[Izotopia](https://bnr.bg/horizont/izotopia/broadcast)" [[üá´](https://www.facebook.com/IzotopiaBNR)] to talk about some of the most pressing issues in technology today. As part of the [OpenFest](https://www.openfest.org/2024/en/) team, we delved into the world of open source, the evolving landscape of internet freedom, and the role of AI in this digital age.

We explored how the principles of open source still play a vital role in preserving the freedoms many of us take for granted online. We discussed the challenges of privacy in a world dominated by targeted advertising, particularly on chat clients and social networks that often prioritize profits over user rights.

The conversation also touched on how the hacker community can push for greater transparency and ownership of our digital lives‚Äîan idea that will be at the core of OpenFest 2024, an event dedicated to hackers, DIY enthusiasts, and those who want to learn practical skills like soldering.

Special thanks to my friend Konstantin Mravov, who hosted and conducted the interview!

It is available only in Bulgarian..

I also invite everyone to join us at OpenFest 2024 on the 2nd and 3rd of November. This year‚Äôs theme, ‚ÄúBack to the source,‚Äù celebrates open source, freedom, and independence. OpenFest is for everyone passionate about these values‚Äîand even for those who might not yet realize how important they are. Come be part of the conversation, whether you have a bunch of severs in the garage and beard or just curious!
