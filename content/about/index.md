![Me](img/avatar.png) My name is Blagovest Petrov and this is my personal blog. Here I'm writing mainly about Linux, System Administration and DevOps. The purpose of most of the posts is to track what I have done over the years for myself.

Currently I'm a DevOps team lead at IBM.

In my free time I like to go kayaking on dams or to the Greek seasisde, visiting music festivals, working on DIY projects, etc.. :) <<put another trival template resume here.>>
